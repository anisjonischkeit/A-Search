# A* Search
## Introduction
This is a graph search implementation of the A* search algorithm. It finds the quickest route to a location. This implementation requires a calculated heuristic and because I have the heuristic to g in this graph, we can only find the shortest route to g
In this implementation I have hardcoded the path from s to g.
## Demo
You can see a working demo of the program on [my portfolio](http://www.anis.com.au). The demo uses the same method as described here, however, without a heuristic. A start and end location can be set
